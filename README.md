# Cars Directory
Dear Mr Ahmed,

 Thanks a lot for this task i learn a lot form it.

 You need to install and start server as the following:
 1- npm install
 2- node .

- Users has isAdmin and isSuperAdmin properties for Authentication

- You can register as (User, Admin, SuperAdmin) by POST method then to generate the token users/login
- To logout users/login

- SuperAdmin as you asked will be the only one can Add or Edit in Brands/Models/Cars
- only required for post "Create" new (brands, models, cars) [name],[modelId for Cars, brandId for Models] else is optional.

- You can get all Models that this brand contains brands/{id}/models
- You can get all Models that this brand contains models/{id}/cars

- You can search by name if you are authorized /[brands, models, cars]/searchByName

- all error for Authorization and Authentication and Database will not stop server from running it just unhandled

Have a great day üòâ üòç.
